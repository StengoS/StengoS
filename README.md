Hi there! I'm @StengoS/Steven Ngo, software engineering undergrad senior with a minor in psychology at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. As of fall quarter '22, I am a teaching assistant for CSC321 (Intro to Computer Security) and a research assistant for Dr. Ayaan Kazerouni. With Dr. Kazerouni, we are working on a method of providing targeted mutation testing recommendations of which mutators should be focused on when test case suites have met particular coverage metrics. I am also continuing my research with Dr. Dave DeAngelis and Dr. Luis Garcia at USC Info Sciences Institute, where we are working on modeling human operators' decision-making in safety-critical industrial control systems.

I'm currently applying to computer science Ph.D's and other similar programs with the intent of studying research problems at the intersection of software engineering and software security. I am open to all research experiences, particularly in areas of software engineering and software security, as I explore which topics best align with my personal motivations and background before I choose to specialize. I am also interested in computer security education and security capture-the-flag events!

You can reach me at sngo12@calpoly.edu or stengo46@gmail.com.
