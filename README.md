Hi there! I'm @StengoS/Steven Ngo, a third-year software engineering Ph.D. student at the University of California, Irvine (UCI)’s Informatics Department with [Dr. Joshua Garcia](https://jgarcia.ics.uci.edu/) as my advisor. I did my undergrad in software engineering with a minor in psychology at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. I particularly enjoy research in the areas of software security, developer-centered security, and software engineering & security education.

I have previous experience with threat modeling processes, Android program analysis, open-source security, software mutation testing, cyber-physical systems, and IoT security. 

## Undergrad Research Experiences:
* Optimizing mutation testing through targeted mutation operator selection using conditional coverage with Dr. Ayaan Kazerouni, Cal. Poly. SLO (Fall 2022 - Spring 2023)
* [Modeling human-cyber interactions in safety-critical cyber-physical/industrial control systems](https://stengos.github.io/files/REUNS_2022_Paper_Ready__CHIMPS_-1.pdf) with Dr. Luis Garcia, University of Utah, and Dr. Dave DeAngelis, Aerospace Corporation (Summer 2022)
  * Published in REU Workshop on Networking and Systems (REUNS) 2022
* XSOC CORP light-weight cryptographic benchmarking w/ Dr. Zachary Peterson, Cal. Poly. SLO (Winter 2021 - Spring 2022)
* Software security analysis on Internet-of-Things applications with/ Dr. Phoenix Fang, Cal. Poly. SLO (Summer 2020)

## Miscellaneous:
* My online handle is `stengo`.
* I have a pet cat named Honey!
