Hi there! I'm @StengoS/Steven Ngo, a second-year software engineering Ph.D. student at University of California, Irvine (UCI)’s Informatics Department with Dr. Joshua Garcia as my advisor. I did my undergrad in software engineering w/ a minor in psychology at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. I particularly enjoy research in the areas of empirical software security, security engineering processes, and software engineering & education.

I am also a security research engineer intern at Samsung Research America under Dr. Mike Grace's Knox security team, president of Cyber@UCI, and '23-'24 National Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC) finalist (4th place w/ UCI). 

I have previous experience with Android program analysis, open-source security, software mutation testing, cyber-physical systems, and IoT security. I also try to participate in security capture-the-flag competitions when I can and am looking for a team to grow and compete with!

## Undergrad Research Experiences:
* Optimizing mutation testing through targeted mutation operator selection using conditional coverage w/ Dr. Ayaan Kazerouni, Cal. Poly. SLO (Fall 2022 - Spring 2023)
* Modeling human-cyber interactions in safety-critical cyber-physical/industrial control systems w/ Dr. Luis Garcia, University of Utah, and Dr. Dave DeAngelis, Aerospace Corporation (Summer 2022)
  * https://stengos.github.io/files/REUNS_2022_Paper_Ready__CHIMPS_-1.pdf (published in REU Workshop on Networking and Systems 2022, REUNS)
* XSOC CORP light-weight cryptographic benchmarking w/ Dr. Zachary Peterson, Cal. Poly. SLO (Winter 2021 - Spring 2022)
* Software security analysis on internet-of-things applications w/ Dr. Phoenix Fang, Cal. Poly. SLO (Summer 2020)

## Miscellaneous:
* I have a pet cat named Honey!
