Hi there! I'm [@StengoS/Steven Ngo](https://stengos.github.io), a third-year software engineering Ph.D. student at the University of California, Irvine (UCI)’s Informatics Department with [Dr. Joshua Garcia](https://jgarcia.ics.uci.edu/) as my advisor ([SORA Lab](https://github.com/Software-Aurora-Lab)). I did my undergrad in software engineering with a minor in psychology at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. I particularly enjoy research in the areas of software security, developer-centered security, and software engineering & security education.

I have previous experience with threat modeling processes, Android program analysis, open-source security, software mutation testing, cyber-physical systems, and IoT security.
