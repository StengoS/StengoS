Hi there! I'm @StengoS/Steven Ngo, a first-year software engineering Ph.D. student at University of California, Irvine (UCI)’s Informatics Department with Dr. Joshua Garcia as my advisor. I did my undergrad in software engineering w/ a minor in psychology at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. As of fall quarter ‘23, I am exploring projects in Dr. Garcia’s lab group, the SORA (Software Aurora) Lab, which includes Android analysis, autonomous driving testing & analysis, architectural programming-language modules, and open-source security.

I am most interested in software security, human elements of software engineering & security, and security education, and I have previous experience with software mutation testing, cyber-physical systems, and IoT security. I also try to participate in security capture-the-flag competitions when I can and am looking for a team to grow and compete with!

## Research Experiences:
* Optimizing mutation testing through targeted mutation operator selection using conditional coverage w/ Dr. Ayaan Kazerouni, Cal. Poly. SLO (Fall 2022 - Spring 2023)
* Modeling human-cyber interactions in safety-critical cyber-physical/industrial control systems w/ Dr. Luis Garcia, University of Utah, and Dr. Dave DeAngelis, Aerospace Corporation (Summer 2022)
  * https://stengos.github.io/files/REUNS_2022_Paper_Ready__CHIMPS_-1.pdf (published in REU Workshop on Networking and Systems 2022, REUNS)
* XSOC CORP light-weight cryptographic benchmarking w/ Dr. Zachary Peterson, Cal. Poly. SLO (Winter 2021 - Spring 2022)
* Software security analysis on internet-of-things applications w/ Dr. Phoenix Fang, Cal. Poly. SLO (Summer 2020)

## Other Things I Wanted to List:
* I have a pet cat named Honey!
