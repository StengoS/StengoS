Hi there! I'm @StengoS/Steven Ngo, and I'm an incoming software engineering Ph.D. student @ UC Irvine advised by Dr. Josh Garcia. I did my undergrad in software engineering w/ a minor in psychology at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. My exact research directions are still undetermined, but I am highly interested in software security and software developers' mental models, attitudes, and habits. I am also interested in computing education (ed for all, security).


## On-Going Research/Projects:
* Optimizing mutation testing using conditional coverage w/ Dr. Ayaan Kazerouni, Cal. Poly. SLO (as of Spring 2023)

## Previous Experiences:
* Modeling human-cyber interactions in safety-critical cyber-physical/industrial control systems w/ Dr. Luis Garcia, USC ISI, and Dr. Dave DeAngelis, Aerospace Corporation (Summer 2022)
  * https://stengos.github.io/files/REUNS_2022_Paper_Ready__CHIMPS_-1.pdf (published in REU Workshop on Networking and Systems 2022, REUNS)
* XSOC CORP light-weight cryptographic benchmarking w/ Dr. Zachary Peterson, Cal. Poly. SLO (Winter 2021 - Spring 2022)
* Software security analysis on internet-of-things applications w/ Dr. Phoenix Fang, Cal. Poly. SLO (Summer 2020)

## Other Things I Wanted to List:
* I have a pet cat named Honey!
